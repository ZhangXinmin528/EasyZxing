Usage
---

Add dependencies in build.gradle.

	Maven Center

	Gradle has a built-in configuration to access the Central Repository via HTTP.

	repositories {
		mavenCentral()
	 }

	To access the Central Repository with Gradle via HTTPS you can define a Maven repository specifying the URL.

	repositories {
		maven {     url "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2"   }
		}

	dependencies {
		implementation "io.github.zhangxinmin528.zxing:core:1.0.2"
        implementation "com.google.zxing:core:3.4.1"
	}
